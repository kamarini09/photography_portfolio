# Photography Portfolio

## Overview

This is a small project I created to gain experience with Next.js, a popular React framework. As a frontend developer student, I wanted to make something that reflects my passion for photography, so I designed a web application that showcases my photography skills and provides an immersive viewing experience.

The project is designed to offer different display modes for images on each page, and it's continuously evolving as I try new things and implement new features.

## Features

- Unique display modes for images on each page.
- Easy navigation between different pages.
- Responsive design for a smooth viewing experience on desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js, React, CSS, and HTML.
- Additional libraries used for UI design and image optimization.

## Installation and Usage

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` on your web browser to view the application.

You can also access the live site at [insert URL] to view the project in action. Use the navigation menu to explore different pages and display modes.

## Future Development

I plan to add more display modes and page designs to provide a richer user experience. I also plan to improve image loading and caching for faster performance, as well as integrate the application with a backend API for dynamic content and user interaction.
